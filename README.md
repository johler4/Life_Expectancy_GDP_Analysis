# life_expectancy_gdp
**Life Expectancy/GDP Portfolio Project**

For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, I will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

**Project Objectives:**
- Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations.
- Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations.
- Preprocess, explore, and analyze data.


**Steps**
1) Initiate folders/files.
2) Observe data and put forward questions that will give meaningful insight of the available data.
3) Analyze/manipulate data to be able to present answers to questions. Include visuals and clear-cut, non-confusing summaries of findings.
