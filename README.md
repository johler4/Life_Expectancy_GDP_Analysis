# Life Expectancy/GDP Portfolio Project
For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, I will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

### Skills
Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, seaborn, data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization, communicating results.

## Project Objectives:
- Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations.
- Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations.
- Preprocess, explore, and analyze data.


**Steps**
1) Initiate folders/files.
2) Observe data and put forward questions that will give meaningful insight of the available data.
3) Analyze/manipulate data to be able to present answers to questions. Include visuals and clear-cut, non-confusing summaries of findings.


**Conclusion**
- I found that overall GDP and life expectancy growth (for the countries we were given data on) had a positive linear correlation. Zimbabwe's information created a bit of outlying data in the dataset, but I was able to isolate/remove that data when necessary.
- Learned how to create choropleth maps for displaying data.
- Learned more about general graphing and selection of graphs depending on univariate, bivariate, or multivariate quantitative and categorical variable selection.
